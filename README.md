### Background
Over 10 years of experience in scientific research solving complex problems in Medical Physics through computer simulations using different approaches such as Monte Carlo and Numerical Analysis. Proven success in performing Data Analysis to the simulationâ€™s output by attaining a high repertory of high-impact scientific papers involving more than 100 citations. Finally, I am always interested to learn new techniques and skills to deliver projects of the highest quality.
